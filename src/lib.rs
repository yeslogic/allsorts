//! # Font parser, shaping engine, and subsetter
//!
//! Allsorts is a font parser, shaping engine, and subsetter for OpenType, WOFF, and WOFF2
//! written entirely in Rust. It was extracted from
//! [Prince](https://www.princexml.com/), a tool that typesets and lays out HTML
//! and CSS documents into PDF.
//!
//! The Allsorts shaping engine was developed in conjunction with [a specification
//! for OpenType shaping](https://github.com/n8willis/opentype-shaping-documents/),
//! which aims to specify OpenType font shaping behaviour.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * **Parse** TrueType (`ttf`), OpenType (`otf`), WOFF, and WOFF2 files.
//! * **Shape** Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, [Indic
//!   scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India) (Bengali,
//!   Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Sinhala, Tamil,
//!   Telugu), Khmer, Lao, Latin, Syriac, Thai, and other scripts.
//! * **Subset** from TrueType, OpenType, WOFF, and WOFF2 files into OpenType.
//!
//! ## What is font shaping?
//!
//! Font shaping is the process of taking text in the form of Unicode codepoints
//! and a font, and laying out glyphs from the font according to the text. This
//! involves honouring kerning, ligatures, and substitutions specified by the font.
//! For some languages this is relatively straightforward. For others, such as
//! Indic scripts it is quite complex. After shaping, another library such as
//! [Pathfinder](https://github.com/servo/pathfinder) or
//! [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/) is responsible for rendering the glyphs.
//! To learn more about text rendering, Andrea Cognolato has a good [overview of
//! modern font rendering on
//! Linux](https://mrandri19.github.io/2019/07/24/modern-text-rendering-linux-overview.html).
//! The concepts remain similar on other platforms.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! Refer to the [Allsorts Tools repository](https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts-tools) for
//! a set of tools that exercise Allsorts font parsing, shaping, and subsetting.
//!
//! ## Unimplemented Features / Known Issues
//!
//! We don't currently support:
//!
//! * Shaping Mongolian, and Tibetan.
//! * Apple's [morx table](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6morx.html).
//! * Unicode normalisation.
//!
//! Known limitations:
//!
//! * The crate is not extensively documented yet ([#5](https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts/issues/5)).
//! * Allsorts does not do font lookup/matching. For this something like
//!   [font-kit](https://github.com/pcwalton/font-kit) is recommended.
//!
//! ## Development Status
//!
//! Allsorts is still under active development but reached its first release
//! milestone with its inclusion in Prince 13. In Prince it is responsible for
//! all font loading, and font shaping.
//!
//! Currently, the font parsing code is handwritten. It is planned for this to
//! eventually be replaced by machine generated code via our [declarative data
//! definition language project](https://github.com/yeslogic/fathom).
//!
//! ## Platform Support
//!
//! Allsorts CI runs tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Via Prince it is also
//! built for FreeBSD.
//!
//! ## Building and Testing
//!
//! **Minimum Supported Rust Version:** 1.66.0
//!
//! To build the crate ensure you have [Rust 1.66.0 or newer installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
//!
//! Build with `cargo build` and run the tests with `cargo test`.
//!
//! ### Cargo Features
//!
//! | Feature       | Description                              | Default Enabled | Extra Dependencies    |
//! |---------------|------------------------------------------|:---------------:|-----------------------|
//! | `outline`     | Enable code for accessing glyph outlines |        ✅       | `pathfinder_geometry` |
//! | `flate2_zlib` | Use the zlib backend to flate2           |        ✅       | `zlib`                |
//! | `flate2_rust` | Use the Rust backend to flate2           |        ❌       | `miniz_oxide`         |
//! | `prince`      | Enable Prince specific tests and code    |        ❌       |                       |
//!
//! **Note:** In our testing the `zlib` `flate2` backend was faster but you may
//! prefer the Rust backend for a pure Rust solution when compiling to WASM or
//! similar.
