# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog], and this project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning].

## [Unreleased]

- Support for mark filtering sets.
- Support for shaping text that uses Myanmar script, such as Burmese.
- Parse `head` table up front in `Font`. Public `head_table` field
  replaces `head_table` method.
- Introduce `MissingTable` variant to `ParseError`. This is used in
  place of `MissingValue` in the default implementation of
  `read_table_data` in `FontTableProvider`.

## [0.15.0] - 2024-06-06

### Added

- Support for instancing variable fonts and reading variable font
  related tables such as `fvar`, `gvar`, `avar`.
- Support for CFF2: Reading, instancing, subsetting to CFF, and extracting
  outlines.
- Refactor Glyph types to be more compact and track phantom points.
- Ability to generate a HTML font specimen. Gated behind off-by-default
  `specimen` feature.

### Changed

- Use default feature mask when shaping Thai and Lao text.
- `pathfinder_geometry` is no longer optional as it's used for variable fonts.
- Apply `rvrn` early in shaping.
- Use bitflags for `macStyle` and `fsSelection`.
- Introduce `RawGlyphFlags` for tracking glyph flags.
- Add `ParseError::UnsuitableCmap` and change `Font::new` to return
  `Result<Font, _>` instead of `Result<Option<Font>, _>`.

- Support for GSUB Lookup Type 8 (Reverse Chaining Contextual Single
  Substitution).
